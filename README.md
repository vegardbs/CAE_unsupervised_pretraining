# Ridge-I interview assesment project

This repository contains the following:

1. A pdf article where I explain the model and methods employed.
2. A Jupyter notebook with the code and a usage example.
3. A Colab notebook with the code and a usage example. 
3. A python script with an implementation of tied 2D transpose convolutional layers.

Since the notebook was originally written in Google Colab, I recommend checking the colab notebook before the jupyter one.
