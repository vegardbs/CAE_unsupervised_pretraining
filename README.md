# Ridge-I interview assesment project

This repository contains the following:

1. An article where I explain the model and methods employed
2. A notebook with the code used. The notebook was written in Google Colab and run on their free GPU, and I strongly recommend review in the notebook in the collab environment, since the smaller width of the jupyter notebook editor squishes the text and makes it less readable.
3. A python script with an implementation of tied 2D transpose convolutional layers.
