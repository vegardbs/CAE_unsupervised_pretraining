# Ridge-I interview assesment project

This repository contains the following:

1. A pdf article where I explain the model and methods employed.
2. A Jupyter notebook with the code and a usage example.
3. A Colab notebook with the code and a usage example. (click open in colab)
3. A python script with an implementation of tied 2D transpose convolutional layers.

Since the notebook was originally written in Google Colab, I recommend checking the colab notebook before the jupyter one. The jupyter notebook code blocks are more narrow than the Colab ones, so in Jupyter the code sometimes gets unintentionally split into two lines.
