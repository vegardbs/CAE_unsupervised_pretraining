# Ridge-I interview assesment project

This repository contains the following:

1. An article where I explain the model and methods employed
2. A notebook with the code used. The notebook was written in Google Colab and run on their free GPU, and I strongly recommend reviewing in the notebook in the Collab environment or in Jupyter notebook, since the display width of notebooks in Github is so narrow that code gets unintentionally separated into multiple lines.
3. A python script with an implementation of tied 2D transpose convolutional layers.
